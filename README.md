## Docker Support
For those who have Homeassistant running on Docker, not supervised by HASS, the NetDaemon can be shipped as a container and ran in parallel.

To build the image simply execute the build command in the root of the solution

```
docker build . --tag netdaemon:latest
```

After the image has been built, you can deploy the container using the following command. It is advised to map the `/data` folder of the container to a local folder as the daemon's apps are linked to this folder.

The following environment variables are available to identify your Home Assistant instance
* `HASS_HOST`, defaults to *localhost*
* `HASS_PORT`, default to *8123*
* `HASS_TOKEN` needs to be set to a valid access token.

Example giving: 
```
docker run -v -e HASS_HOST=192.168.1.1 -e HASS_TOKEN=ey123... ~/netdaemon_config:/data --name netdaemon netdaemon
```

## Example apps
